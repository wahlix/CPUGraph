# CPUgraph

This was a side object by me (Rickard Wahlander) during my education to become an IT security developer.

## Description

`CPUgraph.py` is a Python script that retrieves and displays CPU usage information for the top 10 processes running on a Windows machine. It uses the `subprocess` module to run a PowerShell command that fetches this information, and then uses `pandas` and `matplotlib` to process and visualize the data.



## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
